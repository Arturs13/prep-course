## Prerequisites 

We assume that you have already did some coding [@codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com), but to better understand what we are going to do - take a look at these free resources:

 - [TypeScript in 5 minutes @typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
