## Work Station Setup

### Visual Studio Code

We are going to use a text editor, which is pretty popular amongst developers. Download & install from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com), after the installation make sure that everything works fine.

### NodeJS & npm



### Git

We will use Git as our Version Control System. It's like Dropbox for developers. But much better!

Follow [this guide from Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#setting-up-git) to setup Git.

> What is "version control"? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
> 
> It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

What is **Github**? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and share your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.

### Verify that you are ready

It is very easy to check if everything was installed correctly, just open terminal and type in some commands:

 - check Git version: `git --version`
 - check NodeJs version: `node -v`
 - check npm version: `npm -v`
