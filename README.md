# Work Station Setup

## Visual Studio Code

We are going to use a text editor, which is pretty popular amongst developers. Download & install from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com), after the installation make sure that everything works fine.

## node & npm

> [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org) is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

To execute code written by you, we are going to use **node**, [download & install *Current* version](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Verify

 - check node version: `node -v`
 - check npm version: `npm -v`

## Git

We will use Git as our Version Control System. It's like Dropbox for developers. But much better!

Follow [this guide from Github](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git#setting-up-git) to setup Git.

> What is "version control"? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
> 
> It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

What is **Git**? Git is one of many Version Control Systems available to use, and by far [the most popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2015#tech-sourcecontrol).

What is **Github**? Github is a very popular site where you can publish and share your Git repositories, share and collaborate with other people.
