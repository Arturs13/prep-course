# Tic Tac Toe

We are going to create Tic Tac Toe game. There is already UI prepared, so we must just make it work.

But we are not some lame coders, who just write code. We want our code to work, so we are going to write using Test Driven Development (TDD) approach. Which means that we start with a failing test and only then write an implementation.

There is one test scenario already prepared.

## Getting Ready

As always, open this folder in the Visual Studio Code and download all the dependencies by executing `npm install`

## Executing Tests

Open terminal and execute command: `npm test`

## Running Application

To launch game open terminal and execute command: `npm start`, there will url, most likely `http://localhost:1234` so just open that in your browser.
