# Easy Exercises

Probably most of the *Warm Up* exercises are finished if you have managed to get this far.

Have you noticed that it is pretty cumbersome to check output all the time? If the same approach would be used in the real life development speed would suffer.

There is a better way - tests!

 > There is no one who should write tests for your code!!! Your code - your responsibility!

But only this time - tests are written by us, using very popular library - [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

Your goal for this part is to have all of the tests green.

## Getting Ready

As before, open this folder in the Visual Studio Code and download all the dependencies by executing `npm install`

## Executing Test

In the `src` directory are multiple directories. Each of them contains two files, one has the code inside, which you are going to modify and the second one is test which you are not allowed to modify.

Start in the ascending order, by looking at the **code and test** (it is very important to read the test also) try to figure out what you need to do.

Execute single test with command `npm test src/00-acronym/`
